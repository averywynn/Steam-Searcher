# Steam-Searcher
The goal of this project is to create a Steam Recommendation extension for Google using natural language processing. The end goal is for users to be able to input some kind of information (perhaps the names of some games that they like, or write a short review of why they enjoy a particular game), which the program will then use to provide some recommendations.
